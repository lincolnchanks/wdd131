			<h1>Silverlight Search Site Plan</h1>
			<h2>Lincoln Hanks</h2>
			<h2>WDD 131-01</h2>
			<!-- In the header above, add the name or your site, your name and class number. For example if you are in section 3 you would put WDD 131.03 -->

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of Silverlight Search is to provide fast, easy information about each character in Brandon Sanderson's cosmere.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience will be fans of Brandon Sanderson's fantasy books, ideally those who have read most of his fantasy books, so as to avoid spoilers.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>This website will use sorting, filtering, and object arrays to organize a collection of "character cards". Each character card will contain basic information about a character, along with a link to a website with information on that character. The link will always point to the same page, but the page will populate with information that matches the selected character (I assume that'll work, but if it doesn't I'll just make separate pages for each character).</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo (Resize Later)</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

And my attempts to generate pictures of them with AI failed miserably. So this is the plan for now. I use these pictures with the understanding that I shouldn't ever advertise this website publicly. I will give image credit to the artists, however.</p>
			<h3>Character Page</h3>
			<h1>Hoid</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Yolen</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> Mistborn Era 1 & 2, The Stormlight Archive, Warbreaker, Elantris, The Sunlit Man, and various cameos</p>

<p><strong>Other Info:</strong> Uses many aliases, including Wit and Dust</p>
<p>Hoid is one of the oldest and most enigmatic beings in the Cosmere, originating from the hidden world of Yolen. He inserts himself into major historical moments across planets, often serving as a wandering storyteller, musician, or advisor. His eccentric humor masks deep knowledge and complicated emotions, and his true motivations remain partially hidden.</p>
<p>Despite his tendency to keep people at arm’s length, Hoid forms quiet connections with individuals he meets, guiding or nudging them when it suits a greater purpose. Over time, he has acquired access to multiple magic systems, though he avoids direct violence due to personal oaths. His presence is a thread weaving through the entire Cosmere.</p>

<h1>Kelsier</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Scadrial</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> Mistborn: The Final Empire, The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages, Mistborn: Secret History</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Allomancy (Mistborn)</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> Leader of the skaa rebellion, Survivorist figure, early founder of the Ghostbloods</p>
<p>Kelsier began as a gifted thief whose life was shaped by tragedy, especially the death of his wife. His time in the Pits of Hathsin awakened his Allomancy and transformed him into a bold, charismatic revolutionary known as the Survivor. His reckless confidence and fierce belief in hope rallied the oppressed of the Final Empire.</p>
<p>Even after his death, Kelsier’s determination and refusal to fade from history allow him to influence events on Scadrial and beyond. His curiosity about the greater Cosmere and relentless will to survive set him apart as one of its most persistent and disruptive figures.</p>

<h1>Vin</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Scadrial</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> Mistborn Era 1</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Allomancy (Mistborn)</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> Kelsier’s Crew, Final Empire rebellion</p>
<p>Vin begins as a street orphan skilled at avoiding attention and betrayal. Her discovery as a powerful Mistborn thrusts her into the center of a rebellion aiming to overthrow a thousand-year empire. Her introverted and suspicious nature slowly softens as she learns to trust those around her.</p>
<p>As she grows into her powers, Vin becomes a nearly unstoppable force who seeks truth, justice, and connection in a harsh world. Her emotional journey parallels Scadrial’s transformation from oppression to hope.</p>

<h1>Elend Venture</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Scadrial</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> Mistborn Era 1 (Books 2–3)</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Allomancy (enhanced by lerasium)</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> New Empire leadership, scholarly circles</p>
<p>Elend is a nobleman with a gentle temperament and a love for books and political philosophy. Even in a corrupt society, he imagines a more ideal and equitable form of government. His relationship with Vin pushes him to take responsibility for the world around him.</p>
<p>Though not initially a powerful Allomancer or a strong leader, Elend grows into both roles as he faces apocalyptic threats. His idealism, tempered by difficult choices, defines his impact on Scadrial’s future.</p>

<h1>Kaladin Stormblessed</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Roshar</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> The Stormlight Archive</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Surgebinding (Windrunner)</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> Knights Radiant, Bridge Four, Alethi military</p>
<p>Kaladin begins life as a surgeon’s son but becomes a soldier, slave, and eventually a leader of men. His deep sense of responsibility and fierce desire to protect others define his character. Though burdened by depression, he continually pushes forward for the sake of those who rely on him.</p>
<p>Through his bond with Sylphrena, Kaladin gains the powers of a Windrunner, granting him the ability to manipulate gravity and pressure. His journey explores trauma, leadership, and the struggle to hold onto hope in moments of darkness.</p>

<h1>Shallan Davar</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Roshar</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> The Stormlight Archive</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Surgebinding (Lightweaver), Soulcasting</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> Knights Radiant, complicated involvement with the Ghostbloods</p>
<p>Shallan is a brilliant artist with a traumatic past and a personality shaped by layers of self-deception. Her Lightweaving abilities complement her natural observational skills, allowing her to recreate what she sees—or imagines—with stunning accuracy.</p>
<p>Throughout her journey, Shallan confronts painful truths while juggling political intrigue, espionage, and Radiant responsibilities. Her story centers on identity, perception, and the healing power of creativity and truth.</p>

<h1>Dalinar Kholin</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Roshar</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> The Stormlight Archive</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Surgebinding (Bondsmith)</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> Alethi Highprinces, Knights Radiant, the Coalition</p>
<p>Dalinar is a former warlord known in his youth as the Blackthorn, feared for his unmatched brutality in battle. Visions from the deceased Shard Honor push him toward a very different path: one of peace, unity, and moral responsibility.</p>
<p>As a Bondsmith, Dalinar channels extraordinary spiritual power and serves as a unifying force for the Radiants and the world. His transformation from destroyer to builder forms a central emotional arc of the Stormlight Archive.</p>

<h1>Adolin Kholin</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Roshar</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> The Stormlight Archive</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Shardbearer; unique bond with Maya</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> Alethi nobility, Kholin army, Radiant-affiliated forces</p>
<p>Adolin is a charismatic prince and master duelist who relies on skill and empathy rather than magical power. He is genuinely kind, supportive, and driven to do what he believes is right, even when it conflicts with cultural expectations.</p>
<p>His relationship with Maya, a deadeye spren, marks one of the most unusual developments in Roshar’s magical landscape. Adolin’s journey emphasizes compassion, integrity, and challenging tradition.</p>

<h1>Sigzil / Nomad</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Roshar</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> The Stormlight Archive, The Sunlit Man</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Surgebinding (Windrunner squire), Dawnshard-influenced Investiture</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> Bridge Four, Worldsingers (later)</p>
<p>Sigzil begins as a thoughtful scribe in Bridge Four, shaped by his experiences with slavery, strict rules, and deep guilt. His analytical mind contrasts with Kaladin’s instinctive leadership, but he becomes a valued companion and later a Worldsinger.</p>
<p>By the era of The Sunlit Man, Sigzil has transformed into Nomad, a weary worldhopper burdened with unstable powers and a painful past. His story is one of escape, redemption, and perseverance despite overwhelming odds.</p>

<h1>Tanavast</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Roshar</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> The Stormlight Archive</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Shardic Investiture (Honor)</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> The Heralds, ancient Rosharan leadership</p>
<p>Tanavast was the original Vessel of Honor and shaped the foundational principles behind the Knights Radiant and their oaths. Known for passion and nobility, he viewed bonds and commitments as sacred forces that tied people and worlds together.</p>
<p>After his death, fragments of his consciousness survived in visions shown to Dalinar. These remnants reveal a god exhausted by war but desperate to prepare humankind for what was coming. His legacy permeates Roshar’s spiritual and magical systems.</p>

<h1>Rashek (The Lord Ruler)</h1>
<p><strong>Home Planet:</strong> Scadrial</p>
<p><strong>Books Appearing In:</strong> Mistborn Era 1</p>
<p><strong>Magic Systems:</strong> Allomancy (enhanced), Feruchemy, Compounding</p>
<p><strong>Alliances:</strong> The Final Empire, Steel Ministry</p>
<p>Rashek was originally a Terrisman who rose to godlike power after a series of dramatic events led him to take control of immense Investiture. He reshaped Scadrial and ruled for a thousand years as the Lord Ruler, maintaining an oppressive but strangely stable empire.</p>
<p>Though tyrannical, Rashek believed he was preserving the world from destruction, even if it required brutality. His mastery of Feruchemy and Allomancy made him one of the most powerful individuals in Cosmere history, and his legacy remains a complex blend of fear, awe, and reluctant respect.</p>
